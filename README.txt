--- In early prototype / development phase ---
A small Netty library built for sending and receiving google protocol buffers. 
For custom protobuf data, create a proto file in the folder 'protobuf_files' and run the script 'generate_proto_files'.
You can create custom Client and Server data handler classes that extend the protobuffer type you just created to use.
Using ClientDataHandler and ServerDataHandler as examples.
